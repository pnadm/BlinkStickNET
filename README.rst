ðŸŽ‰ BlinkStickNET for .NET 6.0! ðŸŽ‰
======
Tested and working on Linux with a BlinkStick Nano.  

- The files in this branch are mostly stock. (not counting a few useless syntax modifications I'm too lazy to rollback.) 
- An example console app project has been included. Refer to the original work for more usage examples.
- I will not test the Windows code. Some of it has been commented.


Please Note
======
At least for Linux, you can't execute Read/Write commands to the device without permission.

You will need to create UDEV rules or do a terrible thing and use `sudo dotnet run`. 


What Changed?
======
A lot and nothing at the same time. 

- Cleaned out the solution & project files. Removed all local dependency and example files.
- Replaced the  `LibUsbDotNet <https://www.nuget.org/packages/LibUsbDotNet/2.2.29>`_ & `HidSharp <https://www.nuget.org/packages/HidSharp/2.1.0>`_ dependencies with their current stable NuGet versions.


What's Next?
======
Nothing. This repository will remain mostly as-is to preserve what's left of the integrity of the original product. 

I may accept a few bugfix related PRs over time, but I will refuse any request to modify the code.


Sincerely,
 \- The Administrator.
